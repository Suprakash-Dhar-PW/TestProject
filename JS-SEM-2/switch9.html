    switch (true){ //RULE 1: (i)type must be exactly matched(It uses strict comparison)
                //(ii)Internally the data would be stored in the form of key value pair (Map) for comparison
            case (n>=15 && n<=20): 
                 //RULE 2: (i)Cases can be duplicated as JavaScript is Object based
                console.log("It is in the range of 15-20");
                break;              //(ii)As it is Object based so it would work as key value pair
            default:    //RULE 3: Case Level value can be of any type because internaly it uses value for a map
                console.log("Default");
                break;
            // default:    //RULE 3: Case Level value can be of any type because internaly it uses value for a map
            //     console.log("Default");
            //     break;//RULE 4: Even String type value is supported for a key in switch
        }//RULE 5: It is possible to wirte one block for multiple cases
        //RULE 6: Never use NaN as a value in switch i.e NaN should never be used for comparing
        //why? --> NaN === NaN (false) rest everything is true like null === null(true)
        console.log("Control is ON");

        // FaQ's
        //Can we define switch with default?
        //--> Yes but it is not a good practice as it will show no output
        //Can we define default above and between?
        //Yes, duplicate default case is not permitted
        //Can we use case without "Jump Statement" in switch[break]?
        //Yes we can this phenomenon is refered as 'Fail through'
        //Can we use return as a jump statement in switch?
        //No, it results in 'Syntax error'
        //What is the diff btw break and return?
        //break: It will terminate the block and control will continue with normal flow of execution [Compiler is ON]
        //return: It is permitted but it will use Strict comparison against the value supplied at runtime
        // Can we define multiple cases for a single input
        //Yes, we can define with the help of fallthrough
        //How to define a case with range of values
        // we could write expressions and evaluate within the range like shown above
