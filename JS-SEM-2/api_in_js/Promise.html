<!-- What is a Promise?
=> A Promise is a placeholder for a value that will arrive in the future(usually after an async operation like an API call, timer, file read etc...).
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Remember: "I promisse to give you the result later - either success or failure"

Syntax of promise:
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    //async operation here.....
    if(success){
        resolve(result);  //fullfilled
    }else{
        reject(error);    //rejected
    }
});

resolve() :: when async operation is succesful
reject() :: when async operation is unsuccesful

//handleing the promise
promise
    .then(function(success){
        //resolve logic
    }).catch(function(error){
        //reject logic
    }); -->
