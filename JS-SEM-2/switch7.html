            case null: 
                 //RULE 2: (i)Cases can be duplicated as JavaScript is Object based

                break;
            default:    //RULE 3: Case Level value can be of any type because internaly it uses value for a map
                console.log("Default");
                break;//RULE 4: Even String type value is supported for a key in switch
        }//RULE 5: It is possible to wirte one block for multiple cases
        //RULE 6: Never use NaN as a value in switch i.e NaN should never be used for comparing
        //why? --> NaN === NaN (false) rest everything is true like null === null(true)

        // FaQ's
        //Can we define switch with default?
        //--> Yes but it is not a good practice as it will show no output
